# Cleft Palate Project: Revolutionizing Speech Therapy through Innovative AI Interfaces

The Cleft Palate Project is a set of AI-driven user interfaces that simulate and analyze speech patterns, thereby providing targeted feedback for therapy. The goal of this project is to train an audio model to identify speech impediments. Primarily ideated in an AI Deep Dive Session by Dr. Matthew Pontell, we are interested in exploring how generative AI can aid in the treatment and betterment of speech dysfunctions, and how it can be harnessed to create individualized therapy plans. The application of AI in speech health can significantly accelerate the therapy process, providing real-time analysis and feedback.

## Features
The Cleft Palate Project is suitable for those with and without access to advanced technology. 

* **User Interface**: The model will be accessible from a user interface (web app) for both testing and deployment
* **Phone Interface**: The model will be accessible from anywhere in the world using a phone call line. Users should be able to call a phone number, record their voice sample, and receive an analysis.

## Contributing

To contribute to the project, please contact the DSI staff lead (Myranda Shirk - myranda.shirk@vanderbilt.edu). Our community is supportive, and we provide training and classes if you're new to any of the frameworks used in the project. Everyone is welcome to contribute, as we believe participating in data science and AI projects is an excellent way to learn.
